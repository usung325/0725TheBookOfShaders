            <p class="t0"> The images above were made in different ways. The first one was made by Van Gogh's hand applying layer over layer of paint. It took him hours. The second was produced in seconds by the combination of four matrices of pixels: one for cyan, one for magenta, one for yellow and one for black. The key difference is that the second image is produced in a non-serial way (that means not step-by-step, but all at the same time).

                This book is about the revolutionary computational technique, fragment shaders, that is taking digitally generated images to the next level. You can think of it as the equivalent of Gutenberg's press for graphics.</p>
